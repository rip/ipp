ipp // IP Puller

###### ipp.html

LuCI module prototype.

Just writing a few lines of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a quick little educational exercise.

PoC, nothing special, and does not feature GeoIP lookup.

No connection details or insight for simplicity.

Works well on phones and gaming console browsers.
